# tortlemiata
for my miata, tortle, because why buy something if you can spend hours writing code and troubleshooting for the same effect

While miata.py did not work at all, ELM327 device finnally responded, twice. 
First response was after ATZ, gave back some long hex string and refused to take any other commands. but the little > showed up so cool
Second response gave back ELM327 v1.5.00, could enter in ATZ which would overwrite the ELM327 stuff but after pressed enter either showed up as ELM327 thing again, or just didn't 
respond and i kept overwriting what I preveriously written.
all times after I pressed enter, it would not return carriage or anything, just sit on that first line. also they would just stop doing anything after a while
a "theoretical success" overall
